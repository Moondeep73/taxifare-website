## Here we would like to add some controllers in order to ask the user to select the parameters of the ride

1. Let's ask for:
- date and time
- pickup longitude
- pickup latitude
- dropoff longitude
- dropoff latitude
- passenger count

## Once we have these, let's call our API in order to retrieve a prediction

See ? No need to load a `model.joblib` file in this app, we do not even need to know anything about Data Science in order to retrieve a prediction...

ðŸ¤” How could we call our API ? Off course... The `requests` package ðŸ’¡

2. Let's build a dictionary containing the parameters for our API...

3. Let's call our API using the `requests` package...

4. Let's retrieve the prediction from the **JSON** returned by the API...

## Finally, we can display the prediction to the user
